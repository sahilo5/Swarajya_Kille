It is situated near the town of Velhe, approximately 50 kilometers southwest of Pune city. Torna Fort is one of the oldest forts in the region and holds great importance in the history of the Maratha Empire.<br/><br/>
        
        History:<br>
        Torna Fort has a rich history dating back to ancient times. It was originally built by the Shaiva Panth, a religious sect, and was known as Sudhagad. Later, the fort came under the control of various dynasties, including the Bahamanis and the Nizamshahis.<br/>
        <br/>
        
        In 1646, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire, captured Torna Fort from the Bijapur Sultanate, marking it as one of the first forts he acquired during his military campaigns. Shivaji renamed the fort as "Prachandagad" (meaning "Massive Fort") due to its impressive size and strategic significance.<br/><br/>
