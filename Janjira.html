        Janjira Fort, also known as Murud-Janjira Fort, is an ancient coastal fort located on an island off the Arabian Sea in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. It is situated near the town of Murud, approximately 165 kilometers south of Mumbai. Janjira Fort is renowned for its unique construction, historical significance, and its status as an unconquered fort.<br/><br/>
        
        History:<br>
        Janjira Fort's history dates back to the 15th century when it was built by the Siddis, an African-Indian ethnic group. Malik Ambar, a powerful Siddi ruler, constructed the fort to establish a strong naval base and protect his territories from various foreign invasions.<br/>
        <br/>
        
        The strategic location of the fort on an island surrounded by the sea made it highly impregnable and earned it the reputation of being an unconquered fort. Despite several attempts by powerful rulers and armies, including the Marathas and the British East India Company, Janjira Fort remained unconquered throughout its history.<br/><br/>

        Janjira Fort is renowned for its unique architecture, strong defenses, and engineering ingenuity. Some of the key features of the fort include:<br/><br/>


        Multiple Walls and Gates: The fort is protected by multiple concentric walls and gates, making it challenging for attackers to breach its defenses.
<br>
Round Cannon Bastions: Janjira Fort has several round cannon bastions, each equipped with cannons to repel naval attacks.


<br>
Freshwater Tanks: The fort has large freshwater tanks, which were essential for sustaining the garrison during extended sieges.
<br>Underwater Tunnel: Legend has it that the fort has an underwater tunnel that served as a secret escape route for the Siddi rulers during sieges.<br>
<br>
Trekking and Tourism:<br>
Janjira Fort is a popular tourist destination and attracts history enthusiasts, architecture lovers, and adventure seekers. To reach the fort, visitors have to take a short boat ride from the coastal town of Murud to the island.<br>
Exploring Janjira Fort allows tourists to witness the fort's impressive architecture, learn about its history and the reign of the Siddi rulers, and enjoy the panoramic views of the Arabian Sea.

The fort is now managed and maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and is considered a site of historical and architectural significance in Maharashtra.
