        Tung Fort, also known as Kathingad, is a historical hill fort located in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, India. It is situated near the village of Tungwadi, about 12 kilometers from the hill station of Lonavala and around 110 kilometers from Pune city. The fort is perched at an elevation of approximately 3,500 feet (1,067 meters) above sea level.<br/><br/>
        
        History:<br>
        Tung Fort has a rich history dating back to the 12th century when it was built by the Shaiva Panth, a religious sect. Later, it came under the control of various dynasties, including the Bahamanis and the Nizamshahis. In the 17th century, the fort was captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as part of his expansion plans for the Maratha Empire.<br/><br/>
        
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ruled from Raigad Fort until his death in 1680. The fort continued to be an essential stronghold for the Marathas even after his demise. However, in 1689, during the Battle of Raigad, the fort was captured by the Mughals under the command of Emperor Aurangzeb after Shivaji's son, Sambhaji, was betrayed and captured.The fort's strategic location made it an essential military outpost during Shivaji's reign. It served as a watchtower to keep an eye on the activities in the region and as a stronghold to protect the trade routes that passed through the area. Tung Fort's elevation and steep cliffs made it a difficult fortification to conquer.<br/><br/>
        
        Tung Fort is known for its natural beauty and relatively moderate trekking trail. It offers panoramic views of the Sahyadri mountain range and the surrounding lush green landscape. Some of the prominent features of the fort include:<br/><br/>


        Entrance Gate: The fort's main entrance gate, though in ruins now, still displays the fort's ancient architecture.
<br>
Hanuman Temple: Atop the fort, there is a small temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman, attracting devotees and trekkers alike.
<br>
Caves and Cisterns: The fort has some ancient rock-cut caves and water cisterns that were used to store water during its active periods.
<br>
<br>
Trekking and Tourism:<br>
Tung Fort is a popular destination for trekking enthusiasts, nature lovers, and history buffs. The trek to the fort starts from the base village of Tungwadi and takes approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to reach the summit. The trail passes through dense forests, rocky patches, and steep slopes, offering a thrilling and adventurous experience for trekkers.
<br>
The best time to visit Tung Fort is during the monsoon and winter seasons when the surroundings are green and pleasant. The trek becomes more challenging during the monsoon due to slippery paths, but the refreshing views and waterfalls make it a memorable experience.
