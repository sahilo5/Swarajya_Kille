        Tikona Fort, also known as Vitandgad, is a hill fort located in the Maval region of the Western Ghats in Maharashtra, India. It is situated near the village of Tikona-Peth, approximately 22 kilometers from the hill station of Lonavala and around 60 kilometers from Pune city. The fort stands at an elevation of approximately 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) above sea level.<br/><br/>
        
        History:<br>
        Tikona Fort has a long history that dates back to the Satavahana period, making it over 2,000 years old. The fort changed hands multiple times and was under the control of various dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Shilaharas, and the Bahamanis.<br/>
        <br/>
        
        During the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Tikona Fort was captured from the Nizamshahi dynasty in 1657 CE. It played a significant role in Shivaji's military strategy as it provided a commanding view of the region and guarded the important trade route that passed through the area.<br/><br/>
        
        Tikona Fort is renowned for its pyramid-shaped hill and its strategic location, which offers panoramic views of the Pawna Dam, the Tung Fort, and the surrounding Sahyadri mountain range. Some of the key features of the fort include:<br/><br/>
